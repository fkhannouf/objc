Modified by David Stes on 20/apr/97 to deal with

	const char * msg = "hello"
	#line 320
			   "world";

(This needs to be translated into a single "xstr" reference)

Also added a -s option which allows one to specify a "strings"
database using an absolute path, for use in multiple directories.

Changed file extension from .c to .m (because it's a demo of Objective C now).
